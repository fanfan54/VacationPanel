## What is VacationPanel?
VacationPanel is a **full-featured intranet application** (you'll need to log in with your account in order to use it) that allows enterprises to manage vacations/paid holidays for their staff.

It uses **PHP** on the Apache2 web server (tested on PHP 5.3.10 and 7.2.17) and a **MySQL** database (tested on MySQL 5.5.37 and MariaDB 10.3.12) as a backend, and a simple HTML5 front-end (using jQuery plugins, AJAX for some features), styled with **Twitter Bootstrap**.

The front-end, and some parts of the code, are in french.

I wrote it during a 2 weeks internship at [NETLOR SAS](https://www.netlor.fr), a company that develops business applications, e-commerce websites, B2B and B2C solutions since 2000.
They asked me to do it in order to acquire web development skills, and to (maybe) include my code in their web platform/framework/CMS, DIMS (Dynamic Information Management System).

This code is **very** old, I wasn't at EPITECH and had no formation (I used various MOOCs and tutorials on the web to write this code, that's all), so there can be some errors or bad code.

**I never finished it, many functions are missing/not implemented. Feel free to make pull requests to add some new code! :-)**

## Download
[Download the repository (zip archive)](https://github.com/fanfan54/VacationPanel/archive/master.zip)

## How to use it?

1. Install the prerequisites:

* Apache2 (any version compatible with PHP 5.3)
* PHP 5.3
* MySQL Server Community (5.5.37)

2. Download the VacationPanel repository from GitHub
3. Import the `vacationpanel.sql` file to your database
4. Fill your MySQL server informations manually in the `login.class.php` file *(for now, the `config.php` file is not used in the code)*
5. (optional) if you want to use the built-in PHP server, run `php -S localhost:8080` in the repository folder
6. Go to the index.php page on your web server (http://localhost:8080 if you used the built-in PHP server)
7. Log in to the built-in user account:

* Identifiant: francoislefevre
* Mot de passe (password): stagiaire1


You'll be redirected to the sign-up page. Create any account you want!

### Alternative setup/dependencies

VacationPanel has been tested and is working with a more recent setup:
* PHP 7.2.17 (using its built-in server)
* MariaDB 10.3.12


## User roles

There are 3 roles available for the accounts, with different permissions:

* **admin** : he can go to every module, he's the only one that has access to system settings (Paramètres système). He can create "gestionnaire" and/or "employé" accounts.
* **gestionnaire** ("manager" in french): he can manage vacations ("Gérer les congés"), manage the staff he's affected to (in "Gérer les employés"), and create "employé" accounts.
* **employé** ("staff/employee" in french, referenced in code as "worker"): he can only ask for vacations (in "Demander mes congés") on the datepicker

A single user can have multiple roles, and there can be as many users as you want. You can even create multiple "admin" accounts.

## Modules

5 modules (pages) are available in the application (not all of them have been implemented during my internship), defined in the `vacationpanel.class.php` file and shown in the tabs bar on top of the page:

* **vacationask** / "Demander mes congés" (available for "employé" accounts)
* **vacationmanage** / "Gérer les congés" (available for "manager" accounts)
* **manageusers** / "Gérer les employés" (for "manager" accounts) or "Gérer les gestionnaires" (for "admin" accounts)
* **registerusers** / "Ajouter des employés" (for "manager" accounts) or "Ajouter des gestionnaires" (for "admin" accounts) (fully implemented)
* **systemsettings** / "Paramètres système" (available for "admin" accounts)

Note: there is also an automatic installer module I started (in the `_install.php` file), but I didn't have time to finish it, it's not working (for now), that's why I didn't talk about it.

## Database structure

The default name for the database is "vacationpanel".
It contains two tables:

### dims_mod_vacationpanel_users
Contains 7 columns:

* id
* user (login, between 1 and 255 chars)
* password
* relog_time (timestamp of the last time when the account has been modified (password changed, etc). If an account was logged in (using PHP session cookies) before this time, it has to log back in)
* role ("worker", "manager", "admin", there can be multiple roles separated by semicolons, for example "worker;manager;sysadmin" is a valid input)
* days (number of vacation days available, only used for "worker" accounts)
* isEnabled (boolean, true if the user can log in to his account)

### dims_mod_vacationpanel_vacations
Contains 5 columns:

* id
* userid
* date (all the dates included in the vacation, comma-separated)
* comment (some text that can be saved with the vacation)
* state ("allowed", "asked", "revoked", or "ended")
